STA260 final project: YouTubers' weekly subscriptions and video views since the Covid19 pandemic

## Setup
Steps for collecting url and name of the Youtuber of interest:
* Find the account name of the Youtuber as shown in their channel
* Search for this Youtuber in https://socialblade.com/youtube/
* In the homepage, click on "See full monthly statistics" to go to the detailed statistics page. 
* Now the url should end with "/monthly". Copy this url and enter in https://web.archive.org/
* If the url was not marked before, you will need to mark it yourself first. After that, click on the date which links you to a new url: a historical version of the socialblade website. Copy that url and input into the google sheet. The 'name' is the account name as shown in the url, right before '/monthly'. 
  *  E.g. url: https://web.archive.org/web/20220521004032/https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/pamelarf1/monthly, name: pamelarf1.
